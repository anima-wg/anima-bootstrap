To do this a remote secure key infrastructure (BRSKI) is created using manufacturer installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing service, both online and offline.  Bootstrapping a new device can occur using a routable address and a cloud service, or using only link-local connectivity, or on limited/disconnected networks. Support for lower security models, including devices with minimal identity, is described for legacy reasons but not encouraged.  Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device but the established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well.  </p>

  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">BRSKI provides a solution for secure zero-touch (automated) bootstrap of new (unconfigured) devices that are called pledges in this document.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">This document primarily provides for the needs of the ISP and Enterprise focused ANIMA <a href="#I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane">Autonomic Control Plane (ACP)</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane]</cite>.  Other users of the BRSKI protocol will need to provide separate applicability statements that include privacy and security considerations appropriate to that deployment.  Section <a href="#acpapplicability">Section 9</a> explains the details applicability for this the ACP usage.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This document describes how pledges discover (or be discovered by) an element of the network domain to which the pledge belongs to perform the bootstrap.  This element (device) is called the registrar.  Before any other operation, pledge and registrar need to establish mutual trust: </p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>Registrar authenticating the pledge: "Who is this device? What is its identity?"</li>
  <li>Registrar authorizing the pledge: "Is it mine? Do I want it? What are the chances it has been compromised?"</li>
  <li>Pledge authenticating the registrar: "What is this registrar's identity?"</li>
  <li>Pledge authorizing the registrar: "Should I join it?"</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">This document details protocols and messages to answer the above questions.  It uses a TLS connection and an PKIX (X.509v3) certificate (an IEEE 802.1AR <a href="#IDevID">[IDevID]</a> LDevID) of the pledge to answer points 1 and 2.  It uses a new artifact called a "voucher" that the registrar receives from a "Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority" (MASA) and passes to the pledge to answer points 3 and 4.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">A proxy provides very limited connectivity between the pledge and the registrar.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">The syntactic details of vouchers are described in detail in <a href="#RFC8366">[RFC8366]</a>. This document details automated protocol mechanisms to obtain vouchers, including the definition of a 'voucher-request' message that is a minor extension to the voucher format (see <a href="#voucher-request">Section 3</a>) defined by <a href="#RFC8366">[RFC8366]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">BRSKI results in the pledge storing an X.509 root certificate sufficient for verifying the registrar identity. In the process a TLS connection is established that can be directly used for Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST). In effect BRSKI provides an automated mechanism for the "Bootstrap Distribution of CA Certificates" described in <a href="#RFC7030">[RFC7030]</a> Section 4.1.1 wherein the pledge "MUST [...] engage a human user to authorize the CA certificate using out-of-band" information". With BRSKI the pledge now can automate this process using the voucher. Integration with a complete EST enrollment is optional but trivial.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.9">BRSKI is agile enough to support bootstrapping alternative key infrastructures, such as a symmetric key solutions, but no such system is described in this document.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Prior Bootstrapping Approaches</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">To literally "pull yourself up by the bootstraps" is an impossible action. Similarly the secure establishment of a key infrastructure without external help is also an impossibility. Today it is commonly accepted that the initial connections between nodes are insecure, until key distribution is complete, or that domain-specific keying material (often pre-shared keys, including mechanisms like SIM cards) is pre-provisioned on each new device in a costly and non-scalable manner. Existing automated mechanisms are known as non-secured 'Trust on First Use' (TOFU) <a href="#RFC7435">[RFC7435]</a>, 'resurrecting duckling' <a href="#Stajano99theresurrecting">[Stajano99theresurrecting]</a> or 'pre-staging'.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">Another prior approach has been to try and minimize user actions during bootstrapping, but not eliminate all user-actions.  The original EST protocol <a href="#RFC7030">[RFC7030]</a> does reduce user actions during bootstrap but does not provide solutions for how the following protocol steps can be made autonomic (not involving user actions): </p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>using the Implicit Trust Anchor <a href="#RFC7030">[RFC7030]</a> database to authenticate an owner specific service (not an autonomic solution because the URL must be securely distributed),</li>
  <li>engaging a human user to authorize the CA certificate using out-of-band data (not an autonomic solution because the human user is involved),</li>
  <li>using a configured Explicit TA database (not an autonomic solution because the distribution of an explicit TA database is not autonomic),</li>
  <li>and using a Certificate-Less TLS mutual authentication method (not an autonomic solution because the distribution of symmetric key material is not autonomic).  </li>
</ul>

<p> These "touch" methods do not meet the requirements for zero-touch.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">There are "call home" technologies where the pledge first establishes a connection to a well known manufacturer service using a common client-server authentication model. After mutual authentication, appropriate credentials to authenticate the target domain are transfered to the pledge. This creates serveral problems and limitations:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>the pledge requires realtime connectivity to the manufacturer service,</li>
  <li>the domain identity is exposed to the manufacturer service (this is a privacy concern),</li>
  <li>the manufacturer is responsible for making the authorization decisions (this is a liability concern),</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.6">BRSKI addresses these issues by defining extensions to the EST protocol for the automated distribution of vouchers.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> Terminology</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a> <a href="#RFC8174">[RFC8174]</a> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2">The following terms are defined for clarity:</p>
<p/>

<dl>
  <dt>domainID:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The domain IDentity is the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the BIT STRING of the subjectPublicKey of the pinned-domain-cert leaf, i.e. the Registrars' certificate.  This is consistent with the subject key identifier (<a href="#RFC5280">Section 4.2.1.2</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5280]</cite>).  </dd>
  <dt>drop ship:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The physical distribution of equipment containing the "factory default" configuration to a final destination. In zero-touch scenarios there is no staging or pre-configuration during drop-ship.</dd>
  <dt>imprint:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The process where a device obtains the cryptographic key material to identify and trust future interactions with a network. This term is taken from Konrad Lorenz's work in biology with new ducklings: during a critical period, the duckling would assume that anything that looks like a mother duck is in fact their mother. An equivalent for a device is to obtain the fingerprint of the network's root certification authority certificate. A device that imprints on an attacker suffers a similar fate to a duckling that imprints on a hungry wolf. Securely imprinting is a primary focus of this document <a href="#imprinting">[imprinting]</a>. The analogy to Lorenz's work was first noted in <a href="#Stajano99theresurrecting">[Stajano99theresurrecting]</a>.</dd>
  <dt>enrollment:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The process where a device presents key material to a network and acquires a network specific identity.  For example when a certificate signing request is presented to a certification authority and a certificate is obtained in response.</dd>
  <dt>Pledge:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The prospective device, which has an identity installed at the factory.</dd>
  <dt>Voucher:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A signed artifact from the MASA that indicates to a pledge the cryptographic identity of the registrar it should trust. There are different types of vouchers depending on how that trust is asserted. Multiple voucher types are defined in <a href="#RFC8366">[RFC8366]</a></dd>
  <dt>Domain:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The set of entities that share a common local trust anchor. This includes the proxy, registrar, Domain Certificate Authority, Management components and any existing entity that is already a member of the domain.</dd>
  <dt>Domain CA:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The domain Certification Authority (CA) provides certification functionalities to the domain. At a minimum it provides certification functionalities to a registrar and manages the private key that defines the domain. Optionally, it certifies all elements.</dd>
  <dt>Join Registrar (and Coordinator):</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A representative of the domain that is configured, perhaps autonomically, to decide whether a new device is allowed to join the domain. The administrator of the domain interfaces with a "join registrar (and coordinator)" to control this process. Typically a join registrar is "inside" its domain. For simplicity this document often refers to this as just "registrar". Within <a href="#I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model">[I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model]</a> this is refered to as the "join registrar autonomic service agent".  Other communities use the abbreviation "JRC".  </dd>
  <dt>(Public) Key Infrastructure:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The collection of systems and processes that sustain the activities of a public key system.  The registrar acts as an <a href="#RFC5280">[RFC5280]</a> and <a href="#RFC5272">[RFC5272]</a> (see section 7) "Registration Authority".</dd>
  <dt>Join Proxy:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A domain entity that helps the pledge join the domain. A join proxy facilitates communication for devices that find themselves in an environment where they are not provided connectivity until after they are validated as members of the domain. For simplicity this document sometimes uses the term of 'proxy' to indicate the join proxy. The pledge is unaware that they are communicating with a proxy rather than directly with a registrar.</dd>
  <dt>Circuit Proxy:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A stateful implementation of the join proxy. This is the assumed type of proxy.</dd>
  <dt>IPIP Proxy:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A stateless proxy alternative.</dd>
  <dt>MASA Service:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A third-party Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA) service on the global Internet. The MASA signs vouchers. It also provides a repository for audit log information of privacy protected bootstrapping events. It does not track ownership. </dd>
  <dt>Ownership Tracker:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">An Ownership Tracker service on the global Internet. The Ownership Tracker uses business processes to accurately track ownership of all devices shipped against domains that have purchased them. Although optional, this component allows vendors to provide additional value in cases where their sales and distribution channels allow for accurately tracking of such ownership. Ownership tracking information is indicated in vouchers as described in <a href="#RFC8366">[RFC8366]</a></dd>
  <dt>IDevID:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">An Initial Device Identity X.509 certificate installed by the vendor on new equipment.</dd>
  <dt>TOFU:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">Trust on First Use. Used similarly to <a href="#RFC7435">[RFC7435]</a>. This is where a pledge device makes no security decisions but rather simply trusts the first registrar it is contacted by. This is also known as the "resurrecting duckling" model.</dd>
  <dt>nonced:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">a voucher (or request) that contains a nonce (the normal case).</dd>
  <dt>nonceless:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">a voucher (or request) that does not contain a nonce, relying upon accurate clocks for expiration, or which does not expire.</dd>
  <dt>manufacturer:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">the term manufacturer is used throughout this document to be the entity that created the device.  This is typically the "original equipment manufacturer" or OEM, but in more complex situations it could be a "value added retailer" (VAR), or possibly even a systems integrator.  In general, it a goal of BRSKI to eliminate small distinctions between different sales channels.  The reason for this is that it permits a single device, with a uniform firmware load, to be shipped directly to all customers.  This eliminates costs for the manufacturer.  This also reduces the number of products supported in the field increasing the chance that firmware will be more up to date.  </dd>
  <dt>ANI:</dt>

<h1 id="rfc.section.1.3"><a href="#rfc.section.1.3">1.3.</a> Scope of solution</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.3.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.3.1">1.3.1.</a> Support environment</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.1.p.1">This solution (BRSKI) can support large router platforms with multi-gigabit inter-connections, mounted in controlled access data centers. But this solution is not exclusive to large equipment: it is intended to scale to thousands of devices located in hostile environments, such as ISP provided CPE devices which are drop-shipped to the end user. The situation where an order is fulfilled from distributed warehouse from a common stock and shipped directly to the target location at the request of a domain owner is explicitly supported. That stock ("SKU") could be provided to a number of potential domain owners, and the eventual domain owner will not know a-priori which device will go to which location.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.1.p.2">The bootstrapping process can take minutes to complete depending on the network infrastructure and device processing speed. The network communication itself is not optimized for speed; for privacy reasons, the discovery process allows for the pledge to avoid announcing its presence through broadcasting.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.1.p.3">Nomadic or mobile devices often need to aquire credentials to access the network at the new location.  An example of this is mobile phone roaming among network operators, or even between cell towers.  This is usually called handoff.  BRSKI does not provide a low-latency handoff which is usually a requirement in such situations.  For these solutions BRSKI can be used to create a relationship (an LDevID) with the "home" domain owner. The resulting credentials are then used to provide credentials more appropriate for a low-latency handoff.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.3.2"><a href="#rfc.section.1.3.2">1.3.2.</a> Constrained environments</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.2.p.1">Questions have been posed as to whether this solution is suitable in general for Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This depends on the capabilities of the devices in question. The terminology of <a href="#RFC7228">[RFC7228]</a> is best used to describe the boundaries.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.2.p.2">The solution described in this document is aimed in general at non-constrained (i.e., class 2+) devices operating on a non-Challenged network. The entire solution as described here is not intended to be useable as-is by constrained devices operating on challenged networks (such as 802.15.4 LLNs).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.2.p.3">Specifically, there are protocol aspects described here that might result in congestion collapse or energy-exhaustion of intermediate battery powered routers in an LLN. Those types of networks SHOULD NOT use this solution. These limitations are predominately related to the large credential and key sizes required for device authentication.  Defining symmetric key techniques that meet the operational requirements is out-of-scope but the underlying protocol operations (TLS handshake and signing structures) have sufficient algorithm agility to support such techniques when defined.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.2.p.4">The imprint protocol described here could, however, be used by non-energy constrained devices joining a non-constrained network (for instance, smart light bulbs are usually mains powered, and speak 802.11). It could also be used by non-constrained devices across a non-energy constrained, but challenged network (such as 802.15.4). The certificate contents, and the process by which the four questions above are resolved do apply to constrained devices. It is simply the actual on-the-wire imprint protocol that could be inappropriate.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.3.3"><a href="#rfc.section.1.3.3">1.3.3.</a> Network Access Controls</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.3.p.1">This document presumes that network access control has either already occurred, is not required, or is integrated by the proxy and registrar in such a way that the device itself does not need to be aware of the details. Although the use of an X.509 Initial Device Identity is consistant with IEEE 802.1AR <a href="#IDevID">[IDevID]</a>, and allows for alignment with 802.1X network access control methods, its use here is for pledge authentication rather than network access control. Integrating this protocol with network access control, perhaps as an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method (see <a href="#RFC3748">[RFC3748]</a>), is out-of-scope.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.3.4"><a href="#rfc.section.1.3.4">1.3.4.</a> Bootstrapping is not Booting</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.4.p.1">This document describes "bootstrapping" as the protocol used to obtain a local trust anchor. It is expected that this trust anchor, along with any additional configuration information subsequently installed, is persisted on the device across system restarts ("booting"). Bootstrapping occurs only infrequently such as when a device is transfered to a new owner or has been reset to factory default settings.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.4"><a href="#rfc.section.1.4">1.4.</a> <a href="#PostEnrollment" id="PostEnrollment">Leveraging the new key infrastructure / next steps</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.1">As a result of the protocol described herein, the bootstrapped devices have the Domain CA trust anchor in common. An end entity certificate has optionally been issued from the Domain CA. This makes it possible to securely deploy functionalities across the domain, e.g:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Device management.</li>
  <li>Routing authentication.</li>
  <li>Service discovery.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.5.p.1">The BRSKI protocol can be used in a number of environments. Some of the options in this document are the result of requirements that are out of the ANI scope.  This section defines the base requirements for ANI devices.  </p>

<p>Figure 2: pledge state diagram</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.2">State descriptions for the pledge are as follows:</p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>Discover a communication channel to a registrar.</li>
  <li>Identify itself. This is done by presenting an X.509 IDevID credential to the discovered registrar (via the proxy) in a TLS handshake. (The registrar credentials are only provisionally accepted at this time).</li>
  <li>Request to join the discovered registrar. A unique nonce is included ensuring that any responses can be associated with this particular bootstrapping attempt.</li>
  <li>Imprint on the registrar. This requires verification of the manufacturer service provided voucher. A voucher contains sufficient information for the pledge to complete authentication of a registrar.  This document details this step in depth.  </li>
  <li>Enroll. After imprint an authenticated TLS (HTTPS) connection exists between pledge and registrar.  Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) <a href="#RFC7030">[RFC7030]</a> is then used to obtain a domain certificate from a registrar.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.4">The pledge is now a member of, and can be managed by, the domain and will only repeat the discovery aspects of bootstrapping if it is returned to factory default settings.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.5">This specification details integration with EST enrollment so that pledges can optionally obtain a locally issued certificate, although any REST interface could be integrated in future work.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2.2">2.2.</a> Secure Imprinting using Vouchers</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">A voucher is a cryptographically protected artifact (a digital signature) to the pledge device authorizing a zero-touch imprint on the registrar domain. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.2">The format and cryptographic mechanism of vouchers is described in detail in <a href="#RFC8366">[RFC8366]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.3">Vouchers provide a flexible mechanism to secure imprinting: the pledge device only imprints when a voucher can be validated.  At the lowest security levels the MASA can indiscriminately issue vouchers and log claims of ownership by domains.  At the highest security levels issuance of vouchers can be integrated with complex sales channel integrations that are beyond the scope of this document. The sales channel integration would verify actual (legal) ownership of the pledge by the domain.  This provides the flexibility for a number of use cases via a single common protocol mechanism on the pledge and registrar devices that are to be widely deployed in the field. The MASA services have the flexibility to leverage either the currently defined claim mechanisms or to experiment with higher or lower security levels.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.4">Vouchers provide a signed but non-encrypted communication channel among the pledge, the MASA, and the registrar. The registrar maintains control over the transport and policy decisions allowing the local security policy of the domain network to be enforced.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.3"><a href="#rfc.section.2.3">2.3.</a> <a href="#IDevIDextension" id="IDevIDextension">Initial Device Identifier</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.1">Pledge authentication and pledge voucher-request signing is via a PKIX certificate installed during the manufacturing process. This is the 802.1AR Initial Device Identifier (IDevID), and it provides a basis for authenticating the pledge during the protocol exchanges described here.  There is no requirement for a common root PKI hierarchy.  Each device manufacturer can generate its own root certificate.  Specifically, the IDevID enables: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Uniquely identifying the pledge by the Distinguished Name (DN) and subjectAltName (SAN) parameters in the IDevID. The unique identification of a pledge in the voucher objects are derived from those parameters as described below.  </li>
  <li>Provides a cryptographic authentication of the pledge to the Registrar (see <a href="#pledgeauthorization">Section 5.3</a>).  </li>
  <li>Secure auto-discovery of the pledge's MASA by the registrar (see <a href="#obtainmasaurl">Section 2.8</a>).  </li>
  <li>Signing of voucher-request by the pledge's IDevID (see <a href="#voucher-request">Section 3</a>).  </li>
  <li>Provides a cryptographic authentication of the pledge to the MASA (see <a href="#MASAassertion">Section 5.5.5</a>).  </li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.2">Section 7.2.13 of <a href="#IDevID">[IDevID]</a> discusses keyUsage and extendedKeyUsage extensions in the IDevID certificate.  Any restrictions included reduce the utility of the IDevID and so this specification RECOMMENDS that no key usage restrictions be included.  Additionally, <a href="#RFC5280">[RFC5280]</a> section 4.2.1.3 does not require key usage restrictions for end entity certificates.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.3.1.p.1">In the context of BRSKI, pledges are uniquely identified by a "serial-number". This serial-number is used both in the "serial-number" field of voucher or voucher-requests (see <a href="#voucher-request">Section 3</a>) and in local policies on registrar or MASA (see <a href="#ProtocolDetails">Section 5</a>).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.1.p.2">The following fields are defined in <a href="#IDevID">[IDevID]</a> and <a href="#RFC5280">[RFC5280]</a>: </p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The subject field's DN encoding MUST include the "serialNumber" attribute with the device's unique serial number.  (from <a href="#IDevID">[IDevID]</a> section 7.2.8, and <a href="#RFC5280">[RFC5280]</a> section 4.1.2.4's list of standard attributes) </li>
  <li>The subject-alt field's encoding MAY include a non-critical version of the RFC4108 defined HardwareModuleName.  (from <a href="#IDevID">[IDevID]</a> section 7.2.9) If the IDevID is stored in a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), then this field MAY contain the TPM identification rather than the device's serial number.  If both fields are present, then the subject field takes precedence.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.1.p.4">and they are used as follows by the pledge to build the "serial-number" that is placed in the voucher-request.  In order to build it, the fields need to be converted into a serial-number of "type string".  The following methods are used depending on the first available IDevID certificate field (attempted in this order): </p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#RFC4519">[RFC4519]</a> section 2.31 provides an example ("WI-3005") of the Distinguished Name "serialNumber" attribute.  [RFC4514] indicates this is a printable string so no encoding is necessary.  </li>
  <li>The HardwareModuleName hwSerialNum OCTET STRING. This value is base64 encoded to convert it to a printable string format.  </li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.1.p.5">The above process to locate the serial-number MUST be performed by the pledge when filling out the voucher-request.  Signed voucher-requests are always passed up to the MASA.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.1.p.6">As explained in <a href="#RequestVoucherFromMASA">Section 5.5</a> the Registrar MUST extract the serial-number again itself from the pledge's TLS certificate.  It can consult the serial-number in the pledge-request if there are any possible confusion about the source of the serial-number (hwSerialNum vs serialNumber).  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.3.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2.3.2">2.3.2.</a> <a href="#MASAURL" id="MASAURL">MASA URI extension</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.2.p.1">This docucment defines a new PKIX non-critical certificate extension to carry the MASA URI.  This extension is intended to be used in the IDevID certificate.  The URI is represented as described in Section 7.4 of <a href="#RFC5280">[RFC5280]</a>.  </p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.2.5.1"><a href="#rfc.section.2.5.1">2.5.1.</a> <a href="#pledge-overview" id="pledge-overview">Pledge</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.1.p.1">The pledge is the device that is attempting to join.  Until the pledge completes the enrollment process, it has link-local network connectivity only to the proxy.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.5.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2.5.2">2.5.2.</a> <a href="#proxy-overview" id="proxy-overview">Join Proxy</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.2.p.1">The join proxy provides HTTPS connectivity between the pledge and the registrar. A circuit proxy mechanism is described in <a href="#proxydetails">Section 4</a>. Additional mechanisms, including a CoAP mechanism and a stateless IPIP mechanism are the subject of future work.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.5.3"><a href="#rfc.section.2.5.3">2.5.3.</a> <a href="#registrar-overview" id="registrar-overview">Domain Registrar</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.3.p.1">The domain's registrar operates as the BRSKI-MASA client when requesting vouchers from the MASA (see <a href="#brskimasatls">Section 5.4</a>). The registrar operates as the BRSKI-EST server when pledges request vouchers (see <a href="#brskiesttls">Section 5.1</a>). The registrar operates as the BRSKI-EST server "Registration Authority" if the pledge requests an end entity certificate over the BRSKI-EST connection (see <a href="#ESTintegration">Section 5.9</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.3.p.2">The registrar uses an Implicit Trust Anchor database for authenticating the BRSKI-MASA TLS connection MASA certificate.  The registrar uses a different Implicit Trust Anchor database for authenticating the BRSKI-EST TLS connection pledge client certificate.  Configuration or distribution of these trust anchor databases is out-of-scope of this specification.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.5.4"><a href="#rfc.section.2.5.4">2.5.4.</a> <a href="#masa-overview" id="masa-overview">Manufacturer Service</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.4.p.1">The Manufacturer Service provides two logically seperate functions: the Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA) described in <a href="#RequestVoucherFromMASA">Section 5.5</a> and <a href="#VoucherResponse">Section 5.6</a>, and an ownership tracking/auditing function described in <a href="#pledgestatus">Section 5.7</a> and <a href="#authzLogRequest">Section 5.8</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.5.5"><a href="#rfc.section.2.5.5">2.5.5.</a> <a href="#pki-overview" id="pki-overview">Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.5.p.1">The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) administers certificates for the domain of concerns, providing the trust anchor(s) for it and allowing enrollment of pledges with domain certificates.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.5.p.2">The voucher provides a method for the distribution of a single PKI trust anchor (as the "pinned-domain-cert"). A distribution of the full set of current trust anchors is possible using the optional EST integration.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.5.p.3">The domain's registrar acts as an <a href="#RFC5272">[RFC5272]</a> Registration Authority, requesting certificates for pledges from the Key Infrastructure.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.5.p.4">The expectations of the PKI are unchanged from EST [<a href="#RFC7030">[RFC7030]</a>].  This document does not place any additional architectural requirements on the Public Key Infrastructure.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.6"><a href="#rfc.section.2.6">2.6.</a> <a href="#certificatevalidaty" id="certificatevalidaty">Certificate Time Validation</a></h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.6.1"><a href="#rfc.section.2.6.1">2.6.1.</a> <a href="#timeunknown" id="timeunknown">Lack of realtime clock</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.6.1.p.1">Many devices when bootstrapping do not have knowledge of the current time. Mechanisms such as Network Time Protocols cannot be secured until bootstrapping is complete. Therefore bootstrapping is defined in a method that does not require knowledge of the current time.  A pledge MAY ignore all time stamps in the voucher and in the certificate validity periods if it does not know the current time.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.6.1.p.2">The pledge is exposed to dates in the following five places: registrar certificate notBefore, registrar certificiate notAfter, voucher created-on, and voucher expires-on.  Additionally, CMS signatures contain a signingTime.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.6.1.p.3">If the voucher contains a nonce then the pledge MUST confirm the nonce matches the original pledge voucher-request. This ensures the voucher is fresh.  See <a href="#RequestVoucherFromRegistrar">Section 5.2</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.6.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2.6.2">2.6.2.</a> <a href="#infinitelifetime" id="infinitelifetime">Infinite Lifetime of IDevID</a></h1>
<p><a href="#RFC5280">[RFC5280]</a> explains that long lived pledge certificates "SHOULD be assigned the GeneralizedTime value of 99991231235959Z".  Registrars MUST support such lifetimes and SHOULD support ignoring pledge lifetimes if they did not follow the RFC5280 recommendations.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.6.2.p.2">For example, IDevID may have incorrect lifetime of N &lt;= 3 years, rendering replacement pledges from storage useless after N years unless registrars support ignoring such a lifetime.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.7"><a href="#rfc.section.2.7">2.7.</a> <a href="#cloudregistrar" id="cloudregistrar">Cloud Registrar</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.7.p.1">There exist operationally open network wherein devices gain unauthenticated access to the Internet at large.  In these use cases the management domain for the device needs to be discovered within the larger Internet. These are less likely within the anima scope but may be more important in the future.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.7.p.2">There are additionally some greenfield situations involving an entirely new installation where a device may have some kind of management uplink that it can use (such as via 3G network for instance).   In such a future situation, the device might use this management interface to learn that it should configure itself to become the local registrar.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.7.p.3">In order to support these scenarios, the pledge MAY contact a well known URI of a cloud registrar if a local registrar cannot be discovered or if the pledge's target use cases do not include a local registrar.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.7.p.4">If the pledge uses a well known URI for contacting a cloud registrar an Implicit Trust Anchor database (see <a href="#RFC7030">[RFC7030]</a>) MUST be used to authenticate service as described in <a href="#RFC6125">[RFC6125]</a>. This is consistent with the human user configuration of an EST server URI in <a href="#RFC7030">[RFC7030]</a> which also depends on RFC6125.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.8"><a href="#rfc.section.2.8">2.8.</a> <a href="#obtainmasaurl" id="obtainmasaurl">Determining the MASA to contact</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.8.p.1">The registrar needs to be able to contact a MASA that is trusted by the pledge in order to obtain vouchers. There are three mechanisms described:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.8.p.2">The device's Initial Device Identifier (IDevID) will normally contain the MASA URL as detailed in <a href="#IDevIDextension">Section 2.3</a>. This is the RECOMMENDED mechanism.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.8.p.3">If the registrar is integrated with <a href="#I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud">[I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud]</a> and the pledge IDevID contains the id-pe-mud-url then the registrar MAY attempt to obtain the MASA URL from the MUD file. The MUD file extension for the MASA URL is defined in <a href="#mud-extension">Appendix C</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.8.p.4">It can be operationally difficult to ensure the necessary X.509 extensions are in the pledge's IDevID due to the difficulty of aligning current pledge manufacturing with software releases and development. As a final fallback the registrar MAY be manually configured or distributed with a MASA URL for each manufacturer. Note that the registrar can only select the configured MASA URL based on the trust anchor -- so manufacturers can only leverage this approach if they ensure a single MASA URL works for all pledge's associated with each trust anchor.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#voucher-request" id="voucher-request">Voucher-Request artifact</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">Voucher-requests are how vouchers are requested.  The semantics of the vouchers are described below, in the YANG model.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">A pledge forms the "pledge voucher-request" and submits it to the registrar.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">The registrar in turn forms the "registrar voucher-request", and submits it to the MASA.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">The "proximity-registrar-cert" leaf is used in the pledge voucher-requests. This provides a method for the pledge to assert the registrar's proximity.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">The "prior-signed-voucher-request" leaf is used in registrar voucher-requests. If present, it is the signed pledge voucher-request. This provides a method for the registrar to forward the pledge's signed request to the MASA. This completes transmission of the signed "proximity-registrar-cert" leaf.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.6">Unless otherwise signaled (outside the voucher-request artifact), the signing structure is as defined for vouchers, see <a href="#RFC8366">[RFC8366]</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1"><a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> <a href="#noncelessVoucherRequest" id="noncelessVoucherRequest">Nonceless Voucher Requests</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">A registrar MAY also retrieve nonceless vouchers by sending nonceless voucher-requests to the MASA in order to obtain vouchers for use when the registrar does not have connectivity to the MASA.  No "prior-signed-voucher-request" leaf would be included.  The registrar will also need to know the serial number of the pledge. This document does not provide a mechanism for the registrar to learn that in an automated fashion. Typically this will be done via scanning of bar-code or QR-code on packaging, or via some sales channel integration.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> <a href="#voucher-request-tree-diagram" id="voucher-request-tree-diagram">Tree Diagram</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">The following tree diagram illustrates a high-level view of a voucher-request document.  The voucher-request builds upon the voucher artifact described in <a href="#RFC8366">[RFC8366]</a>.  The tree diagram is described in <a href="#RFC8340">[RFC8340]</a>.  Each node in the diagram is fully described by the YANG module in <a href="#voucher-request-yang-module">Section 3.4</a>.

             remove all prior-signed-voucher-request information when

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">The role of the proxy is to facilitate communications. The proxy forwards packets between the pledge and a registrar that has been provisioned to the proxy via GRASP discovery.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">This section defines a stateful proxy mechanism which is refered to as a "circuit" proxy.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">The proxy does not terminate the TLS handshake: it passes streams of bytes onward without examination.  A proxy MUST NOT assume any specific TLS version.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">A Registrar can directly provide the proxy announcements described below, in which case the announced port can point directly to the Registrar itself.  In this scenario the pledge is unaware that there is no proxing occuring.  This is useful for Registrars servicing pledges on directly connected networks.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.5">As a result of the proxy Discovery process in <a href="#brskigrasp">Section 4.1.1</a>, the port number exposed by the proxy does not need to be well known, or require an IANA allocation.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.6">During the discovery of the Registrar by the Join Proxy, the Join Proxy will also learn which kinds of proxy mechanisms are available.  This will allow the Join Proxy to use the lowest impact mechanism which the Join Proxy and Registrar have in common.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.7">In order to permit the proxy functionality to be implemented on the maximum variety of devices the chosen mechanism SHOULD use the minimum amount of state on the proxy device. While many devices in the ANIMA target space will be rather large routers, the proxy function is likely to be implemented in the control plane CPU of such a device, with available capabilities for the proxy function similar to many class 2 IoT devices.  </p>

<p><a href="#ProtocolDetails">Section 5</a>.  </p>

<ol>
  <li>MUST: Obtains a local address using IPv6 methods as described in <a href="#RFC4862">[RFC4862]</a> IPv6 Stateless Address AutoConfiguration.  Use of <a href="#RFC4941">[RFC4941]</a> temporary addresses is encouraged.  To limit pervasive monitoring ( <a href="#RFC7258">[RFC7258]</a>), a new temporary address MAY use a short lifetime (that is, set TEMP_PREFERRED_LIFETIME to be short).  Pledges will generally prefer use of IPv6 Link-Local addresses, and discovery of proxy will be by Link-Local mechanisms.  IPv4 methods are described in <a href="#IPv4operations">Appendix A</a></li>
  <li>MUST: Listen for GRASP M_FLOOD (<a href="#I-D.ietf-anima-grasp">[I-D.ietf-anima-grasp]</a>) announcements of the objective: "AN_Proxy".  See section <a href="#brskigrasp">Section 4.1.1</a> for the details of the objective.  The pledge MAY listen concurrently for other sources of information, see <a href="#mdnsmethods">Appendix B</a>.  </li>
</ol>

<p> Once a proxy is discovered the pledge communicates with a registrar through the proxy using the bootstrapping protocol defined in </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.4">While the GRASP M_FLOOD mechanism is passive for the pledge, the optional other methods (mDNS, and IPv4 methods) are active.  The pledge SHOULD run those methods in parallel with listening to for the M_FLOOD.  The active methods SHOULD exponentially back-off to a maximum of one hour to avoid overloading the network with discovery attempts.  Detection of change of physical link status (Ethernet carrier for instance) SHOULD reset the exponential back off.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.5">The pledge could discover more than one proxy on a given physical interface.  The pledge can have a multitude of physical interfaces as well: a layer-2/3 Ethernet switch may have hundreds of physical ports.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.6">Each possible proxy offer SHOULD be attempted up to the point where a voucher is received: while there are many ways in which the attempt may fail, it does not succeed until the voucher has been validated.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.7">The connection attempts via a single proxy SHOULD exponentially back-off to a maximum of one hour to avoid overloading the network infrastructure.   The back-off timer for each  MUST be independent of other connection attempts.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.8">Connection attempts SHOULD be run in parallel to avoid head of queue problems wherein an attacker running a fake proxy or registrar could perform protocol actions intentionally slowly.  The pledge SHOULD continue to listen to for additional GRASP M_FLOOD messages during the connection attempts.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.9">Once a connection to a registrar is established (e.g. establishment of a TLS session key) there are expectations of more timely responses, see <a href="#RequestVoucherFromRegistrar">Section 5.2</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.10">Once all discovered services are attempted (assuming that none succeeded) the device MUST return to listening for GRASP M_FLOOD.

<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.1">The MASA voucher response to the registrar is forwarded without changes to the pledge; therefore this section applies to both the MASA and the registrar. The HTTP signaling described applies to both the MASA and registrar responses. A registrar either caches prior MASA responses or dynamically requests a new voucher based on local policy (it does not generate or sign a voucher). Registrar evaluation of the voucher itself is purely for transparency and audit purposes to further inform log verification (see <a href="#auditLogVerification">Section 5.8.2</a>) and therefore a registrar could accept future voucher formats that are opaque to the registrar.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.2">If the voucher-request is successful, the server (MASA responding to registrar or registrar responding to pledge) response MUST contain an HTTP 200 response code. The server MUST answer with a suitable 4xx or 5xx HTTP [RFC2616] error code when a problem occurs.  In this case, the response data from the MASA MUST be a plaintext human-readable (ASCII, English) error message containing explanatory information describing why the request was rejected.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.3">The registrar MAY respond with an HTTP 202 ("the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed") as described in EST <a href="#RFC7030">[RFC7030]</a> section 4.2.3 wherein the client "MUST wait at least the specified 'Retry-After' time before repeating the same request".  (see <a href="#RFC7231">[RFC7231]</a> section 6.6.4) The pledge is RECOMMENDED to provide local feedback (blinked LED etc) during this wait cycle if mechanisms for this are available. To prevent an attacker registrar from significantly delaying bootstrapping the pledge MUST limit the 'Retry-After' time to 60 seconds. Ideally the pledge would keep track of the appropriate Retry-After header values for any number of outstanding registrars but this would involve a state table on the pledge.  Instead the pledge MAY ignore the exact Retry-After value in favor of a single hard coded value (a registrar that is unable to complete the transaction after the first 60 seconds has another chance a minute later). A pledge SHOULD only maintain a 202 retry-state for up to 4 days, which is longer than a long weekend, after which time the enrollment attempt fails and the pledge returns to discovery state.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.4">In order to avoid infinite redirect loops, which a malicious registrar might do in order to keep the pledge from discovering the correct registrar, the pledge MUST NOT follow more than one redirection (3xx code) to another web origins. EST supports redirection but requires user input; this change allows the pledge to follow a single redirection without a user interaction.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.5">A 403 (Forbidden) response is appropriate if the voucher-request is not signed correctly, stale, or if the pledge has another outstanding voucher that cannot be overridden.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.6">A 404 (Not Found) response is appropriate when the request is for a device that is not known to the MASA.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.7">A 406 (Not Acceptable) response is appropriate if a voucher of the desired type or using the desired algorithms (as indicated by the Accept: headers, and algorithms used in the signature) cannot be issued such as because the MASA knows the pledge cannot process that type. The registrar SHOULD use this response if it determines the pledge is unacceptable due to inventory control, MASA audit logs, or any other reason.</p>

There are three times to consider: (a) a configured voucher lifetime in the MASA, (b) the expiry time for the registrar's certificate, (c) any certificate revocation information (CRL) lifetime. The expires-on field SHOULD be before the earliest of these three values.  Typically (b) will be some significant time in the future, but (c) will typically be short (on the order of a week or less).  The RECOMMENDED period for (a) is on the order of 20 minutes, so it will typically determine the lifespan of the resulting voucher.  20 minutes is sufficent time to reach the post-provisional state in the pledge, at which point there is an established trust relationship between pledge and registrar.

The log SHOULD NOT be further reduced but there could exist operational situation where maintaining the full log is not possible. In such situations the log MAY be arbitrarily truncated for length, with the number of removed entries indicated as 'arbitrary'.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.4">If the truncation count exceeds 1024 then the MASA MAY use this value without further incrementing it.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.5">A log where duplicate entries for the same domain have been truncated ("nonced duplicates" and/or "nonceless duplicates) could still be acceptable for informed decisions. A log that has had "arbitrary" truncations is less acceptable but manufacturer transparency is better than hidden truncations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.6">This document specifies a simple log format as provided by the MASA service to the registrar. This format could be improved by distributed consensus technologies that integrate vouchers with technologies such as block-chain or hash trees or optimized logging approaches. Doing so is out of the scope of this document but is an anticipated improvement for future work.  As such, the registrar client SHOULD anticipate new kinds of responses, and SHOULD provide operator controls to indicate how to process unknown responses.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.8.2"><a href="#rfc.section.5.8.2">5.8.2.</a> <a href="#auditLogVerification" id="auditLogVerification">Registrar audit log verification</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.2.p.1">Each time the Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA) issues a voucher, it places it into the audit log for that device.  The details are described in <a href="#authzLogRequest">Section 5.8</a>.  The contents of the audit log can express a variety of trust levels, and this section explains what kind of trust a registrar can derive from the entries.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.2.p.2">While the audit log provides a list of vouchers that were issued by the MASA, the vouchers are issued in response to voucher-requests, and it is the contents of the voucher-requests which determines how meaningful the audit log entries are.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.2.p.3">A registrar SHOULD use the log information to make an informed decision regarding the continued bootstrapping of the pledge. The exact policy is out of scope of this document as it depends on the security requirements within the registrar domain. Equipment that is purchased pre-owned can be expected to have an extensive history.  The following dicussion is provided to help explain the value of each log element:</p>
<p/>

<dl>
  <dt>date:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The date field provides the registrar an opportunity to divide the log around known events such as the purchase date. Depending on context known to the registrar or administrator evens before/after certain dates can have different levels of importance. For example for equipment that is expected to be new, and thus have no history, it would be a surprise to find prior entries.</dd>
  <dt>domainID:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">If the log includes an unexpected domainID then the pledge could have imprinted on an unexpected domain. The registrar can be expected to use a variety of techniques to define "unexpected" ranging from white lists of prior domains to anomoly detection (e.g. "this device was previously bound to a different domain than any other device deployed"). Log entries can also be compared against local history logs in search of discrepancies (e.g. "this device was re-deployed some number of times internally but the external audit log shows additional re-deployments our internal logs are unaware of").</dd>
  <dt>nonce:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">Nonceless entries mean the logged domainID could theoretically trigger a reset of the pledge and then take over management by using the existing nonceless voucher.</dd>
  <dt>assertion:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The assertion leaf in the voucher and audit log indicates why the MASA issued the voucher. A "verified" entry means that the MASA issued the associated voucher as a result of positive verification of ownership but this can still be problematic for registrar's that expected only new (not pre-owned) pledges. A "logged" assertion informs the registrar that the prior vouchers were issued with minimal verification. A "proximity" assertion assures the registrar that the pledge was truly communicating with the prior domain and thus provides assurance that the prior domain really has deployed the pledge.</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.2.p.5">A relatively simple policy is to white list known (internal or external) domainIDs and to require all vouchers to have a nonce and/or require that all nonceless vouchers be from a subset (e.g. only internal) domainIDs. A simple action is to revoke any locally issued credentials for the pledge in question or to refuse to forward the voucher.  A registrar MAY be configured to ignore the history of the device but it is RECOMMENDED that this only be configured if hardware assisted NEA [RFC5209] is supported.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.9"><a href="#rfc.section.5.9">5.9.</a> <a href="#ESTintegration" id="ESTintegration">EST Integration for PKI bootstrapping</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.p.1">The pledge SHOULD follow the BRSKI operations with EST enrollment operations including "CA Certificates Request", "CSR Attributes" and "Client Certificate Request" or "Server-Side Key Generation", etc. This is a relatively seamless integration since BRSKI REST calls provide an automated alternative to the manual bootstrapping method described in <a href="#RFC7030">[RFC7030]</a>. As noted above, use of HTTP 1.1 persistent connections simplifies the pledge state machine.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.p.2">Although EST allows clients to obtain multiple certificates by sending multiple CSR requests BRSKI mandates use of the CSR Attributes request and mandates that the registrar validate the CSR against the expected attributes. This implies that client requests will "look the same" and therefore result in a single logical certificate being issued even if the client were to make multiple requests. Registrars MAY contain more complex logic but doing so is out-of-scope of this specification.  BRSKI does not signal any enhancement or restriction to this capability.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.9.1"><a href="#rfc.section.5.9.1">5.9.1.</a> EST Distribution of CA Certificates</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.1.p.1">The pledge SHOULD request the full EST Distribution of CA Certificates message. See RFC7030, section 4.1.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.1.p.2">This ensures that the pledge has the complete set of current CA certificates beyond the pinned-domain-cert (see <a href="#CompletingAuthenticationBootstrapping">Section 5.6.1</a> for a discussion of the limitations inherent in having a single certificate instead of a full CA Certificates response.) Although these limitations are acceptable during initial bootstrapping, they are not appropriate for ongoing PKIX end entity certificate validation.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.9.2"><a href="#rfc.section.5.9.2">5.9.2.</a> <a href="#csrattributes" id="csrattributes">EST CSR Attributes</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.2.p.1">Automated bootstrapping occurs without local administrative configuration of the pledge. In some deployments it is plausible that the pledge generates a certificate request containing only identity information known to the pledge (essentially the X.509 IDevID information) and ultimately receives a certificate containing domain specific identity information. Conceptually the CA has complete control over all fields issued in the end entity certificate. Realistically this is operationally difficult with the current status of PKI certificate authority deployments, where the CSR is submitted to the CA via a number of non-standard protocols. Even with all standardized protocols used, it could operationally be problematic to expect that service specific certificate fields can be created by a CA that is likely operated by a group that has no insight into different network services/protocols used. For example, the CA could even be outsourced.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.2.p.2">To alleviate these operational difficulties, the pledge MUST request the EST "CSR Attributes" from the EST server and the EST server needs to be able to reply with the attributes necessary for use of the certificate in its intended protocols/services. This approach allows for minimal CA integrations and instead the local infrastructure (EST server) informs the pledge of the proper fields to include in the generated CSR. This approach is beneficial to automated boostrapping in the widest number of environments.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.2.p.3">If the hardwareModuleName in the X.509 IDevID is populated then it SHOULD by default be propagated to the LDevID along with the hwSerialNum. The EST server SHOULD support local policy concerning this functionality.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.2.p.4">In networks using the BRSKI enrolled certificate to authenticate the ACP (Autonomic Control Plane), the EST attributes MUST include the "ACP information" field. See <a href="#I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane">[I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane]</a> for more details.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.2.p.5">The registrar MUST also confirm that the resulting CSR is formatted as indicated before forwarding the request to a CA. If the registrar is communicating with the CA using a protocol such as full CMC, which provides mechanisms to override the CSR attributes, then these mechanisms MAY be used even if the client ignores CSR Attribute guidance.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.9.3"><a href="#rfc.section.5.9.3">5.9.3.</a> EST Client Certificate Request</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.3.p.1">The pledge MUST request a new client certificate. See RFC7030, section 4.2.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.9.4"><a href="#rfc.section.5.9.4">5.9.4.</a> Enrollment Status Telemetry</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.1">For automated bootstrapping of devices, the adminstrative elements providing bootstrapping also provide indications to the system administrators concerning device lifecycle status. This might include information concerning attempted bootstrapping messages seen by the client, MASA provides logs and status of credential enrollment. <a href="#RFC7030">[RFC7030]</a> assumes an end user and therefore does not include a final success indication back to the server. This is insufficient for automated use cases.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.2">To indicate successful enrollment the client SHOULD re-negotiate the EST TLS session using the newly obtained credentials. This occurs by the client initiating a new TLS ClientHello message on the existing TLS connection. The client MAY simply close the old TLS session and start a new one. The server MUST support either model.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.3">In the case of a FAIL, the Reason string indicates why the most recent enrollment failed. The SubjectKeyIdentifier field MUST be included if the enrollment attempt was for a keypair that is locally known to the client. If EST /serverkeygen was used and failed then the field is omitted from the status telemetry.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.4">In the case of a SUCCESS the Reason string is omitted. The SubjectKeyIdentifier is included so that the server can record the successful certificate distribution.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.5">Status media type: application/json</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.6">The client HTTP POSTs the following to the server at the new EST well known URI /enrollstatus.</p>
<pre>{
  "version":"1",
  "Status":TRUE /* TRUE=Success, FALSE=Fail"
  "Reason":"Informative human readable message"
  "reason-context": "Additional information"
}</pre>
<p/>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.8">The server SHOULD respond with an HTTP 200 but MAY simply fail with an HTTP 404 error.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.9">Within the server logs the server MUST capture if this message was received over an TLS session with a matching client certificate.  This allows for clients that wish to minimize their crypto operations to simply POST this response without renegotiating the TLS session - at the cost of the server not being able to accurately verify that enrollment was truly successful.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.9.5"><a href="#rfc.section.5.9.5">5.9.5.</a> Multiple certificates</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.5.p.1">Pledges that require multiple certificates could establish direct EST connections to the registrar.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.9.6.p.1">This document describes extensions to EST for the purposes of bootstrapping of remote key infrastructures.  Bootstrapping is relevant for CoAP enrollment discussions as well. The defintion of EST and BRSKI over CoAP is not discussed within this document beyond ensuring proxy support for CoAP operations. Instead it is anticipated that a definition of CoAP mappings will occur in subsequent documents such as <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est">[I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est]</a> and that CoAP mappings for BRSKI will be discussed either there or in future work.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">The pledge can choose to accept vouchers using less secure methods. These methods enable offline and emergency (touch based) deployment use cases: </p>

<ol>
  <li>The pledge MUST accept nonceless vouchers. This allows for a use case where the registrar can not connect to the MASA at the deployment time.  Logging and validity periods address the security considerations of supporting these use cases.  </li>
  <li>Many devices already support "trust on first use" for physical interfaces such as console ports. This document does not change that reality. Devices supporting this protocol MUST NOT support "trust on first use" on network interfaces. This is because "trust on first use" over network interfaces would undermine the logging based security protections provided by this specification.</li>
  <li>The pledge MAY have an operational mode where it skips voucher validation one time. For example if a physical button is depressed during the bootstrapping operation. This can be useful if the manufacturer service is unavailable. This behavior SHOULD be available via local configuration or physical presence methods (such as use of a serial/craft console) to ensure new entities can always be deployed even when autonomic methods fail. This allows for unsecured imprint.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.2">It is RECOMMENDED that "trust on first use" or any method of skipping voucher validation (including use of craft serial console) only be available if hardware assisted Network Endpoint Assessment [RFC5209] is supported. This recommendation ensures that domain network monitoring can detect innappropriate use of offline or emergency deployment procedures when voucher-based bootstrapping is not used.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.3"><a href="#rfc.section.7.3">7.3.</a> Registrar security reductions</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.1">A registrar can choose to accept devices using less secure methods.  These methods are acceptable when low security models are needed, as the security decisions are being made by the local administrator, but they MUST NOT be the default behavior:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A registrar MAY choose to accept all devices, or all devices of a particular type, at the administrator's discretion. This could occur when informing all registrars of unique identifiers of new entities might be operationally difficult.</li>
  <li>A registrar MAY choose to accept devices that claim a unique identity without the benefit of authenticating that claimed identity. This could occur when the pledge does not include an X.509 IDevID factory installed credential. New Entities without an X.509 IDevID credential MAY form the <a href="#RequestVoucherFromRegistrar">Section 5.2</a> request using the <a href="#RequestVoucherFromMASA">Section 5.5</a> format to ensure the pledge's serial number information is provided to the registrar (this includes the IDevID AuthorityKeyIdentifier value, which would be statically configured on the pledge.) The pledge MAY refuse to provide a TLS client certificate (as one is not available.) The pledge SHOULD support HTTP-based or certificate-less TLS authentication as described in EST RFC7030 section 3.3.2. A registrar MUST NOT accept unauthenticated New Entities unless it has been configured to do so by an administrator that has verified that only expected new entities can communicate with a registrar (presumably via a physically secured perimeter.)</li>
  <li>A registrar MAY submit a nonceless voucher-requests to the MASA service (by not including a nonce in the voucher-request.) The resulting vouchers can then be stored by the registrar until they are needed during bootstrapping operations. This is for use cases where the target network is protected by an air gap and therefore cannot contact the MASA service during pledge deployment.</li>
  <li>A registrar MAY ignore unrecognized nonceless log entries. This could occur when used equipment is purchased with a valid history being deployed in air gap networks that required permanent vouchers.</li>
  <li>A registrar MAY accept voucher formats of future types that can not be parsed by the Registrar. This reduces the Registrar's visibility into the exact voucher contents but does not change the protocol operations.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.4"><a href="#rfc.section.7.4">7.4.</a> <a href="#masasecurityreductions" id="masasecurityreductions">MASA security reductions</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.1">Lower security modes chosen by the MASA service affect all device deployments unless bound to the specific device identities. In which case these modes can be provided as additional features for specific customers. The MASA service can choose to run in less secure modes by:</p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>Not enforcing that a nonce is in the voucher. This results in distribution of a voucher that never expires and in effect makes the Domain an always trusted entity to the pledge during any subsequent bootstrapping attempts. That this occurred is captured in the log information so that the registrar can make appropriate security decisions when a pledge joins the Domain. This is useful to support use cases where registrars might not be online during actual device deployment. Because this results in a long lived voucher and does not require the proof that the device is online, this is only accepted when the registrar is authenticated by the MASA and authorized to provide this functionality. The MASA is RECOMMENDED to use this functionality only in concert with an enhanced level of ownership tracking (out-of-scope.) If the pledge device is known to have a real-time-clock that is set from the factory, use of a voucher validity period is RECOMMENDED.</li>
  <li>Not verifying ownership before responding with a voucher. This is expected to be a common operational model because doing so relieves the manufacturer providing MASA services from having to track ownership during shipping and supply chain and allows for a very low overhead MASA service. A registrar uses the audit log information as a defense in depth strategy to ensure that this does not occur unexpectedly (for example when purchasing new equipment the registrar would throw an error if any audit log information is reported.) The MASA SHOULD verify the 'prior-signed-voucher-request' information for pledges that support that functionality. This provides a proof-of-proximity check that reduces the need for ownership verification.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.10.1.p.3">Additionally the domainID captures only the unauthenticated subject key identifier of the domain. A privacy sensitive domain could theoretically generate a new domainID for each device being deployed. Similarly a privacy sensitive domain would likely purchase devices that support proximity assertions from a manufacturer that does not require sales channel integrations. This would result in a significant level of privacy while maintaining the security characteristics provided by Registrar based audit log inspection.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.10.2"><a href="#rfc.section.10.2">10.2.</a> What BRSKI-MASA reveals to the manufacturer</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.2.p.1">The so-called "call-home" mechanism that occurs as part of the BRSKI-MASA connection standardizes what has been deemed by some as a sinister mechanism for corporate oversight of individuals.  (<a href="#livingwithIoT">[livingwithIoT]</a> and <a href="#IoTstrangeThings">[IoTstrangeThings]</a> for a small sample).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.2.p.2">As the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) usage of BRSKI is not targetted at individual usage of IoT devices, but rather at the Enterprise and ISP creation of networks in a zero-touch fashion, the "call-home" represents a different kind of concern.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.2.p.3">It needs to be re-iterated that the BRSKI-MASA mechanism only occurs once during the comissioning of the device.  It is well defined, and although encrypted with TLS, it could in theory be made auditable as the contents are well defined.  This connection does not occur when the device powers on or is restarted for normal routines.  It is conceivable that a device could be forced to go through a full factory reset during an exceptional firmware update situation, after which enrollment would have be repeated.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.2.p.4">The BRSKI call-home mechanism is mediated via the owner's Registrar, and the information that is transmitted is directly auditable by the device owner.    This is in stark constrast to many "call-home" protocols where the device autonomously calls home and uses an undocumented protocol.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.2.p.5">While the contents of the signed part of the pledge voucher request can not be changed, they are not encrypted at the registrar.  The ability to audit the messages by the owner of the network prevents exfiltration of data by a nefarious pledge.  The contents of an unsigned voucher request are, however, completely changeable by the Registrar.   Both are, to re-iterate, encrypted by TLS while in transit.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.2.p.6">The BRSKI-MASA exchange reveals the following information to the manufacturer: </p>

<ul>
  <li>the identity of the device being enrolled (down to the serial-number!).  </li>
  <li>an identity of the domain owner in the form of the domain trust anchor.  However, this is not a global PKI anchored name within the WebPKI, so this identity could be pseudonymous.  If there is sales channel integration, then the MASA will have authenticated the domain owner, either via pinned certificate, or perhaps another HTTP authentication method, as per <a href="#MASAauthenticationOfRegistrar">Section 5.5.3</a>.  </li>
  <li>the time the device is activated, </li>
  <li>the IP address of the domain Owner's Registrar.  For ISPs and Enterprises, the IP address provides very clear geolocation of the owner.  No amount of IP address privacy extensions (<a href="#RFC4941">[RFC4941]</a>) can do anything about this, as a simple whois lookup likely identifies the ISP or Enterprise from the upper bits anyway.  A passive attacker who observes the connection definitely may conclude that the given enterprise/ISP is a customer of the particular equipment vendor.  The precise model that is being enrolled will remain private.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.2.p.7">The above situation is to be distinguished from a residential/individual person who registers a device from a manufacturer: that an enterprise/ISP purchases routing products is hardly worth mentioning.  Deviations would, however, be notable.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.2.p.8">The situation is not improved by the enterprise/ISP using anonymization services such as <a href="#Dingledine2004">ToR</a> <cite title="NONE">[Dingledine2004]</cite>, as a TLS 1.2 connection will reveal the ClientCertificate used, clearly identifying the enterprise/ISP involved.  TLS 1.3 is better in this regard, but an active attacker can still discover the parties involved by performing a Man-In-The-Middle-Attack on the first attempt (breaking/killing it with a TCP RST), and then letting subsequent connection pass through.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.2.p.9">A manufacturer could attempt to mix the BRSKI-MASA traffic in with general traffic their site by hosting the MASA behind the same (set) of load balancers that the companies normal marketing site is hosted behind.  This makes lots of sense from a straight capacity planning point of view as the same set of services (and the same set of Distributed Denial of Service mitigations) may be used.  Unfortunately, as the BRSKI-MASA connections include TLS ClientCertificate exchanges, this may easily be observed in TLS 1.2, and a traffic analysis may reveal it even in TLS 1.3.  This does not make such a plan irrelevant.  There may be other organizational reasons to keep the marketing site (which is often subject to frequent redesigs, outsourcing, etc.) seperate from the MASA, which may need to operate reliably for decades.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.10.3"><a href="#rfc.section.10.3">10.3.</a> Manufacturers and Used or Stolen Equipment</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.1">As explained above, the manufacturer receives information each time that a device which is in factory-default mode does a zero-touch bootstrap, and attempts to enroll into a domain owner's registrar.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.2">The manufacturer is therefore in a position to decline to issue a voucher if it detects that the new owner is not the same as the previous owner.  </p>

<ol>
  <li>This can be seen as a feature if the equipment is believed to have been stolen.  If the legitimate owner notifies the manufacturer of the theft, then when the new owner brings the device up, if they use the zero-touch mechanism, the new (illegitimate) owner reveals their location and identity.  </li>
  <li>In the case of Used equipment, the initial owner could inform the manufacturer of the sale, or the manufacturer may just permit resales unless told otherwise.  In which case, the transfer of ownership simply occurs.  </li>
  <li>A manufacturer could however decide not to issue a new voucher in response to a transfer of ownership.  This is essentially the same as the stolen case, with the manufacturer having decided that the sale was not legitimate.  </li>
  <li>There is a fourth case, if the manufacturer is providing protection against stolen devices.  The manufacturer then has a responsability to protect the legitimate owner against fraudulent claims that the the equipment was stolen.  Such a claim would cause the manufacturer to refuse to issue a new voucher. Should the device go through a deep factory reset (for instance, replacement of a damaged main board component, the device would not bootstrap.  </li>
  <li>Finally, there is a fifth case: the manufacturer has decided to end-of-line the device, or the owner has not paid a yearly support amount, and the manufacturer refuses to issue new vouchers at that point.  This last case is not new to the industry: many license systems are already deployed that have significantly worse effect.  </li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.3">This section has outlined five situations in which a manufacturer could use the voucher system to enforce what are clearly license terms.  A manufacturer that attempted to enforce license terms via vouchers would find it rather ineffective as the terms would only be enforced when the device is enrolled, and this is not (to repeat), a daily or even monthly occurrance.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.10.4"><a href="#rfc.section.10.4">10.4.</a> Manufacturers and Grey market equipment</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.4.p.1">Manufacturers of devices often sell different products into different regional markets.  Which product is available in which market can be driven by price differentials, support issues (some markets may require manuals and tech-support to be done in the local language), government export regulation (such as whether strong crypto is permitted to be exported, or permitted to be used in a particular market).  When an domain owner obtains a device from a different market (they can be new) and transfers it to a different location, this is called a Grey Market.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.4.p.2">A manufacturer could decide not to issue a voucher to an enterprise/ISP based upon their location.  There are a number of ways which this could be determined: from the geolocation of the registrar, from sales channel knowledge about the customer, and what products are (un-)available in that market.  If the device has a GPS the coordinates of the device could even be placed into an extension of the voucher.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.4.p.3">The above actions are not illegal, and not new.  Many manufacturers have shipped crypto-weak (exportable) versions of firmware as the default on equipment for decades.  The first task of an enterprise/ISP has always been to login to a manufacturer system, show one's "entitlement" (country informatin, proof that support payments have been made), and receive either a new updated firmware, or a license key that will activate the correct firmware.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.4.p.4">BRSKI permits the above process to automated (in an autonomic fashion), and therefore perhaps encourages this kind of differentiation by reducing the cost of doing it.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.4.p.5">An issue that manufacturers will need to deal with in the above automated process is when a device is shipped to one country with one set of rules (or laws or entitlements), but the domain registry is in another one.  Which rules apply is something will have to be worked out: the manufacturer could come to believe they are dealing with Grey market equipment, when it is simply dealing with a global enterprise.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.10.5"><a href="#rfc.section.10.5">10.5.</a> Some mitigations for meddling by manufacturers</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.5.p.1">The most obvious mitigation is not to buy the product.  Pick manufacturers that are up-front about their policies, who do not change them gratutiously.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.5.p.2">A manufacturer could provide a mechanism to manage the trust anchors and built-in certificates (IDevID) as an extension.  This is a substantial amount of work, and may be an area for future standardization work.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.5.p.3">Replacement of the voucher validation anchors (usually pointing to the original manufacturer's MASA) with those of the new owner permits the new owner to issue vouchers to subsequent owners. This would be done by having the selling (old) owner to run a MASA.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.5.p.4">In order to automatically find the new MASA, the mechanism describe in this document is to look for the MASA URL extension in the IDevID.  A new owner could override this in their Registrar, or the manufacturer could provide a mechanism to update or replace the IDevID prior to sale.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.5.p.5">Once the voucher trust anchor and the IDevID is replaced, then the device will no longer trust the manufacturer in any way.  When a new owner performs a bootstrap, the device will point to a MASA that has been chosen, and will validate vouchers from this new entity.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.5.p.6">The BRSKI protocol depends upon a trust anchor on the device and an identity on the device.  Management of these these entities facilitiates a few new operatonal modes without making any changes to the BRSKI protocol.  Those modes include: offline modes where the domain owner operates an internal MASA for all devices, resell modes where the first domain owner becomes the MASA for the next (resold-to) domain owner, and services where an aggregator acquires a large variety of devices, and then acts as a pseudonymized MASA for a variety of devices from a variety of manufacturers.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.5.p.7">Some manufacturers may wish to consider replacement of the IDevID as an indication that the device's warantee is terminated. For others, the privacy requiments of some deployments might consider this a standard operating practice.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.5.p.8">As discussed at the end of <a href="#MASAauditlog">Section 5.8.1</a>, new work could be done to use a distributed consensus technology for the audit log.  This would permit the audit log to continue to be useful, even when there is a chain of MASA due to changes of ownership.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.11"><a href="#rfc.section.11">11.</a> <a href="#securityconsiderations" id="securityconsiderations">Security Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">This document details a protocol for bootstrapping that balances operational concerns against security concerns. As detailed in the introduction, and touched on again in <a href="#reducedsecuritymodes">Section 7</a>, the protocol allows for reduced security modes.  These attempt to deliver additional control to the local administrator and owner in cases where less security provides operational benefits. This section goes into more detail about a variety of specific considerations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.2">To facilitate logging and administrative oversight, in addition to triggering Registration verification of MASA logs, the pledge reports on voucher parsing status to the registrar. In the case of a failure, this information is informative to a potentially malicious registrar. This is mandated anyway because of the operational benefits of an informed administrator in cases where the failure is indicative of a problem. The registrar is RECOMMENDED to verify MASA logs if voucher status telemetry is not received.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.3">To facilitate truely limited clients EST RFC7030 section 3.3.2 requirements that the client MUST support a client authentication model have been reduced in <a href="#reducedsecuritymodes">Section 7</a> to a statement that the registrar "MAY" choose to accept devices that fail cryptographic authentication. This reflects current (poor) practices in shipping devices without a cryptographic identity that are NOT RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.4">During the provisional period of the connection the pledge MUST treat all HTTP header and content data as untrusted data. HTTP libraries are regularly exposed to non-secured HTTP traffic: mature libraries should not have any problems.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.5">Pledges might chose to engage in protocol operations with multiple discovered registrars in parallel. As noted above they will only do so with distinct nonce values, but the end result could be multiple vouchers issued from the MASA if all registrars attempt to claim the device. This is not a failure and the pledge choses whichever voucher to accept based on internal logic. The registrars verifying log information will see multiple entries and take this into account for their analytics purposes.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.11.1"><a href="#rfc.section.11.1">11.1.</a> <a href="#dosmasa" id="dosmasa">DoS against MASA</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.1">There are uses cases where the MASA could be unavailable or uncooperative to the Registrar. They include active DoS attacks, planned and unplanned network partitions, changes to MASA policy, or other instances where MASA policy rejects a claim. These introduce an operational risk to the Registrar owner in that MASA behavior might limit the ability to bootstrap a pledge device. For example this might be an issue during disaster recovery. This risk can be mitigated by Registrars that request and maintain long term copies of "nonceless" vouchers. In that way they are guaranteed to be able to bootstrap their devices.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.2">The issuance of nonceless vouchers themselves creates a security concern. If the Registrar of a previous domain can intercept protocol communications then it can use a previously issued nonceless voucher to establish management control of a pledge device even after having sold it. This risk is mitigated by recording the issuance of such vouchers in the MASA audit log that is verified by the subsequent Registrar and by Pledges only bootstrapping when in a factory default state. This reflects a balance between enabling MASA independence during future bootstrapping and the security of bootstrapping itself.  Registrar control over requesting and auditing nonceless vouchers allows device owners to choose an appropriate balance.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.3">The MASA is exposed to DoS attacks wherein attackers claim an unbounded number of devices. Ensuring a registrar is representative of a valid manufacturer customer, even without validating ownership of specific pledge devices, helps to mitigate this. Pledge signatures on the pledge voucher-request, as forwarded by the registrar in the prior-signed-voucher-request field of the registrar voucher-request, significantly reduce this risk by ensuring the MASA can confirm proximity between the pledge and the registrar making the request. This mechanism is optional to allow for constrained devices. Supply chain integration ("know your customer") is an additional step that MASA providers and device vendors can explore.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.11.2"><a href="#rfc.section.11.2">11.2.</a> Freshness in Voucher-Requests</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.2.p.1">A concern has been raised that the pledge voucher-request should contain some content (a nonce) provided by the registrar and/or MASA in order for those actors to verify that the pledge voucher-request is fresh.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.2.p.2">There are a number of operational problems with getting a nonce from the MASA to the pledge. It is somewhat easier to collect a random value from the registrar, but as the registrar is not yet vouched for, such a registrar nonce has little value.  There are privacy and logistical challenges to addressing these operational issues, so if such a thing were to be considered, it would have to provide some clear value.  This section examines the impacts of not having a fresh pledge voucher-request.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.2.p.3">Because the registrar authenticates the pledge, a full Man-in-the-Middle attack is not possible, despite the provisional TLS authentication by the pledge (see <a href="#ProtocolDetails">Section 5</a>.) Instead we examine the case of a fake registrar (Rm) that communicates with the pledge in parallel or in close time proximity with the intended registrar. (This scenario is intentionally supported as described in <a href="#discovery">Section 4.1</a>.) </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.2.p.4">The fake registrar (Rm) can obtain a voucher signed by the MASA either directly or through arbitrary intermediaries.  Assuming that the MASA accepts the registrar voucher-request (either because Rm is collaborating with a legitimate registrar according to supply chain information, or because the MASA is in audit-log only mode), then a voucher linking the pledge to the registrar Rm is issued.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.2.p.5">Such a voucher, when passed back to the pledge, would link the pledge to registrar Rm, and would permit the pledge to end the provisional state. It now trusts Rm and, if it has any security vulnerabilities leveragable by an Rm with full administrative control, can be assumed to be a threat against the intended registrar.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.2.p.6">This flow is mitigated by the intended registrar verifying the audit logs available from the MASA as described in <a href="#authzLogRequest">Section 5.8</a>. Rm might chose to collect a voucher-request but wait until after the intended registrar completes the authorization process before submitting it. This pledge voucher-request would be 'stale' in that it has a nonce that no longer matches the internal state of the pledge. In order to successfully use any resulting voucher the Rm would need to remove the stale nonce or anticipate the pledge's future nonce state. Reducing the possibility of this is why the pledge is mandated to generate a strong random or pseudo-random number nonce.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.2.p.7">Additionally, in order to successfully use the resulting voucher the Rm would have to attack the pledge and return it to a bootstrapping enabled state. This would require wiping the pledge of current configuration and triggering a re-bootstrapping of the pledge.  This is no more likely than simply taking control of the pledge directly but if this is a consideration the target network is RECOMMENDED to take the following steps: </p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Ongoing network monitoring for unexpected bootstrapping attempts by pledges.</li>
  <li>Retreival and examination of MASA log information upon the occurance of any such unexpected events. Rm will be listed in the logs along with nonce information for analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.section.11.3"><a href="#rfc.section.11.3">11.3.</a> Trusting manufacturers</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.1">The BRSKI extensions to EST permit a new pledge to be completely configured with domain specific trust anchors.  The link from built-in manufacturer-provided trust anchors to domain-specific trust anchors is mediated by the signed voucher artifact.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.2">If the manufacturer's IDevID signing key is not properly validated, then there is a risk that the network will accept a pledge that should not be a member of the network.  As the address of the manufacturer's MASA is provided in the IDevID using the extension from <a href="#IDevIDextension">Section 2.3</a>, the malicious pledge will have no problem collaborating with it's MASA to produce a completely valid voucher.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.3">BRSKI does not, however, fundamentally change the trust model from domain owner to manufacturer.  Assuming that the pledge used its IDevID with RFC7030 EST and BRSKI, the domain (registrar) still needs to trust the manufacturer.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.4">Establishing this trust between domain and manufacturer is outside the scope of BRSKI.  There are a number of mechanisms that can adopted including: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Manually configuring each manufacturer's trust anchor.  </li>
  <li>A Trust-On-First-Use (TOFU) mechanism. A human would be queried upon seeing a manufacturer's trust anchor for the first time, and then the trust anchor would be installed to the trusted store.  There are risks with this; even if the key to name is validated using something like the WebPKI, there remains the possibility that the name is a look alike: e.g, dem0.example. vs demO.example.  </li>
  <li>scanning the trust anchor from a QR code that came with the packaging (this is really a manual TOFU mechanism) </li>
  <li>some sales integration process where trust anchors are provided as part of the sales process, probably included in a digital packing "slip", or a sales invoice.  </li>
  <li>consortium membership, where all manufacturers of a particular device category (e.g, a light bulb, or a cable-modem) are signed by an certificate authority specifically for this.  This is done by CableLabs today. It is used for authentication and authorization as part of TR-79: <a href="#docsisroot">[docsisroot]</a> and <a href="#TR069">[TR069]</a>.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.5">The existing WebPKI provides a reasonable anchor between manufacturer name and public key. It authenticates the key.  It does not provide a reasonable authorization for the manufacturer, so it is not directly useable on it's own.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.11.4"><a href="#rfc.section.11.4">11.4.</a> Manufacturer Maintainance of trust anchors</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.4.p.1">BRSKI depends upon the manufacturer building in trust anchors to the pledge device.  The voucher artifact which is signed by the MASA will be validated by the pledge using that anchor.  This implies that the manufacturer needs to maintain access to a signing key that the pledge can validate.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.4.p.2">The manufacturer will need to maintain the ability to make signatures that can be validated for the lifetime that the device could be onboarded. Whether this onboarding lifetime is less than the device lifetime depends upon how the device is used.  An inventory of devices kept in a warehouse as spares might not be onboarded for many decades.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.4.p.3">There are good cryptographic hygiene reasons why a manufacturer would not want to maintain access to a private key for many decades.  A manufacturer in that situation can leverage a long-term certificate authority anchor, built-in to the pledge, and then a certificate chain may be incorporated using the normal CMS certificate set.  This may increase the size of the voucher artifacts, but that is not a significant issues in non-constrained environements.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.4.p.4">There are a few other operational variations that manufacturers could consider. For instance, there is no reason that every device need have the same set of trust anchors pre-installed.  Devices built in different factories, or on different days, or any other consideration could have different trust anchors built in, and the record of which batch the device is in would be recorded in the asset database.  The manufacturer would then know which anchor to sign an artifact against.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.4.p.5">Aside from the concern about long-term access to private keys, a major limiting factor for the shelf-life of many devices will be the age of the cryptographic algorithms included.  A device produced in 2019 will have hardware and software capable of validating algorithms common in 2019, and will have no defense against attacks (both quantum and von-neuman brute force attacks) which have not yet been invented.  This concern is orthogonal to the concern about access to private keys, but this concern likely dominates and limits the lifespan of a device in a warehouse.  If any update to firmware to support new cryptographic mechanism were possible (while the device was in a warehouse), updates to trust anchors would also be done at the same time.  </p>

<h1 id="rfc.appendix.B"><a href="#rfc.appendix.B">Appendix B.</a> <a href="#mdnsmethods" id="mdnsmethods">mDNS / DNSSD proxy discovery options</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.1">Pledge discovery of the proxy (<a href="#discovery">Section 4.1</a>) MAY be performed with DNS-based Service Discovery <a href="#RFC6763">[RFC6763]</a> over Multicast DNS <a href="#RFC6762">[RFC6762]</a> to discover the proxy at "_brski-proxy._tcp.local.". </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.2">Proxy discovery of the registrar (<a href="#JRCgrasp">Section 4.3</a>) MAY be performed with DNS-based Service Discovery over Multicast DNS to discover registrars by searching for the service "_brski-registrar._tcp.local.".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.3">To prevent unaccceptable levels of network traffic, when using mDNS, the congestion avoidance mechanisms specified in <a href="#RFC6762">[RFC6762]</a> section 7 MUST be followed. The pledge SHOULD listen for an unsolicited broadcast response as described in <a href="#RFC6762">[RFC6762]</a>. This allows devices to avoid announcing their presence via mDNS broadcasts and instead silently join a network by watching for periodic unsolicited broadcast responses.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.4">Discovery of registrar MAY also be performed with DNS-based service discovery by searching for the service "_brski-registrar._tcp.example.com".  In this case the domain "example.com" is discovered as described in <a href="#RFC6763">[RFC6763]</a> section 11 (<a href="#IPv4dhcp">Appendix A.2</a> suggests the use of DHCP parameters).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.5">If no local proxy or registrar service is located using the GRASP mechanisms or the above mentioned DNS-based Service Discovery methods the pledge MAY contact a well known manufacturer provided bootstrapping server by performing a DNS lookup using a well known URI such as "brski-registrar.manufacturer.example.com". The details of the URI are manufacturer specific. Manufacturers that leverage this method on the pledge are responsible for providing the registrar service.  Also see <a href="#cloudregistrar">Section 2.7</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.6">The current DNS services returned during each query are maintained until bootstrapping is completed. If bootstrapping fails and the pledge returns to the Discovery state, it picks up where it left off and continues attempting bootstrapping.  For example, if the first Multicast DNS _bootstrapks._tcp.local response doesn't work then the second and third responses are tried.  If these fail the pledge moves on to normal DNS-based Service Discovery.  </p>
