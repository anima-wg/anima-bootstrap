   Proxy:
     * Action: insert section betweeen 2.4 and 2.5 that indicates the
       proxy is part of the architecture

DONE.

     *                  if you are going to implement a proxy then you
       should support a circuit proxy so that it works with all registrars
     *        add a high level section between s5 and s6 that details
       proxy discussion

DONE.

     *
     * Action: update figure 1 from "dead branch"

DONE.

     * Action: move 4.1.2 to new section.

DONE.

     * Moving on in appendix D:
     * [30]https://github.com/anima-wg/anima-bootstrap/blob/master/dtboots
       trap-anima-keyinfra.txt#L3341
     *
     * Maybe add section 2.0 about MASA to section 2, protocol overview.

DONE.

     * Move section D.1.4 to section 1.3, with reference to ACP.

DONE.

     *
     * TBD: Toerless suggesting text for 1.0 architecture overview.
       Include eg: notion that proxy<->registar network can be ACP and
       role of proxy is to support simplifying pledge initial network
       stack.
     *
     * names from DNSSD -> become objective names   foo._tcp -> AN_foo?
